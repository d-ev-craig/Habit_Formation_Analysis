# Habit Formation in Humans Analysis
This repository was a basic introduction to statistics covering distribtuions, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression.

An in-depth look at the math involved behind these can be found in [ST517](https://github.com/d-ev-craig/ST517AppStatsI) and [ST518](https://github.com/d-ev-craig/ST518AppStatsII).


One of the final assignments was using student procured data to re-create and check the findings of another study using some of the techniques covered in the course.

I reached out to the researchers of [this](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00560/full) longitudinal study about the formation of habits and its relationship to self-percieved levels of self-control. The researchers concluded that there was no significant difference in the ability of a subject to form new habits based on their perceived level of self-control.

The last assignment for this course I ran an ANOVA test across three different levels of self-control groups to check for a difference and confirmed that in the data collected there were no differences in a self-control group to develop a habit.
